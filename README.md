# Welcome 
This is a repository aiming to give readers an introduction to C++. If you are a beginner, I recommend you follow the table of contents in order. If you are just looking for a quick reference, the floor is yours!

Each folder in this repository will have multiple code and lesson files, as well as a bibliography. The table of contents below lists only the lessons within each folder/section, as the coding files supplement those lessons. To access the practice files, please manually move to the corresponding folder!
